        Charminar is a monument and a mosque, which is synonymous with the history of Hyderabad, India. The majestic structure was completed in 1591 CE and is not only a landmark building of Hyderabad but also a famous monument of India. It is believed that Mohammed Quli Qutb Shahi, the fifth sultan of the Qutub Shahi dynasty had built the monument to commemorate the end of a deadly plague menace that had gripped the city then. It is located near the bank of the river Musi. Charminar is derived from two distinct words Char and Minar, which means four towers. Mir Momin Astarabadi of Qutb Shah dynasty played an important role and he ordered extensive preparations for the design and layout. Historians believe that this structure is an example for Indo-Islamic architecture combined with few Persian elements. The monument is located in the heart of old city and it is believed that Hyderabad was measured in four directions from Charminar for administrative purposes.</strong>
