        The noble families of Paigah, during the 18th century were among the most influential and powerful families of the Princely State of Hyderabad’s aristocracy. Claiming to be the descendents of the Hazrath Omar bin Al-Khattab, Islam’s second caliph, the nobles of Paigah were believed to be wealthier than the average Maharajah of the country and they were the only ones to have the privilege maintaining their own court, palaces, as well as their own private armies, which often numbered several thousands. Paigah is a Farsi world, which says “footstool”. It means Right-hand man in English.

        Abdul Fateh Khan Tegh Jung is credited as the founder of the Paigah nobility. He founded the nobility when he served for the second Nizam, Salabat Jang. Sahams-ul-Mulk, Shams-ul-Doula, and Shams-ul-Umara, were the hereditary titles conferred to him by the Nizam. It means “the sun among the masses and nobles”. The Paigahs were given the responsibility to take care of the security and defense of the state. The Paigahs were very close to the Nizams.

        The Paigahs, who were the great patrons of tarts have extended their unmatched grace and elegance even to their exquisite tombs. The Paigah Tombs that grace the city among the many wonders that fill the pages of the most promising history. The marvelous artistry of the Paigahs is shown in the mosaic tile work that has been inlaid. The Paigah tombs, located at the Pisal Banda suburbs in Hyderabad, are most intricately carved and are enclosed in facades of pierced marble. The tombs are the finest examples of the enthralling Indo-Islamic architecture, which is a blend of both features of Asaf Jahi and Rajputani style.
