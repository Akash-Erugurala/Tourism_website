        Warangal is recognized as one of the best heritage cities of India. It is 145 km away from the state capital Hyderabad. It is also the second largest city in the state of Telangana. The city's name is derived from the Telugu word Orugallu – 'Oru' which means one and the word 'gallu' meaning stone.
