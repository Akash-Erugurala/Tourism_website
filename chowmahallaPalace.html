        A testimony to this aspect is seen in the form of the many exquisite monuments scattered all over the city. One such monument that in its striking sumptuousness still shows off the power of time immemorial is the engrossing Chowmahalla Palace. The name Chowmahalla refers to four palaces. The construction of the palace was initiated in the year 1750 by Nizam Salabhat Jung but it was Nizam Afzar-ud-Dawla Bahadur who saw that the palace was completed between the years 1857 and 1869. Originally, the palace covered 45 acres from Laad Bazaar on the north to Aspan Chowk Road which is on the south. The Chowmohalla complex is a replica of Shah’s Palace in Teheran, Iran. Presently the palace consists of two courtyards with graceful palaces, the grand Durbar Hall or the Khilwat. Gardens and fountains add to the elegance.

        Southern Courtyard is the oldest part of the complex. It comprises of four graceful palaces Tahniyat Mahal, Mahtab Mahal, Afzal Mahal, and Aftab Mahal. Northern Courtyard has been restored and is open to the public. The main attraction of this area is the Bara Imam, which is a long corridor. It has rooms on the east wing, which once served as the administrative wing. Another stunning construction is the Clock 
        Tower. It houses the Khilwat Clock which still works perfectly.
