It houses seven tombs dedicated to the former kings of Golconda. The tombs are dome like structures built on a square base. This is again surrounded by pointed arches. Each tomb is of quadrangular shape and rises around 9 to 15 meters above the terrace. The smaller tombs constitute single stories while the larger tombs are seen as two storied. The domes actually constituted of blue and green tiles, whereas only few pieces exist now. The Qutub Shahi Tombs are surrounded by enchanting minarets and there is magnificent tomb with a height of 42.5 m covered by large dome. The tombs were furnished with chandeliers and soft canopies on silver poles. These are the splendid mausoleums of the Golconda Sultans. During the Qutub Shahi period, legend says that these tombs were of great significance that even criminals taking refuge there were given pardon. The tombs were neglected after their reign until Salar Jung III took up their restoration works during the early 19th century.
