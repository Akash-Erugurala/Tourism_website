        <p style="text-align: center;"><em>The name <strong>"Telangana" </strong>refers to the word Trilinga Desa, earned due to the presence of three ancient Shiva Temples at Kaleshwaram, Srisailam, and Draksharamam. A more historical reasoning is that during the reign of Nizams, the region was known as Telugu Angana to differentiate it from the areas where Marathi was spoken.</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><em><u>The Telangana State Tourism Development Corporation (TSTDC)</u> is a state government agency which promotes tourism in Telangana, India. The aim of TSTDC is to provide infrastructure, conveyance and other facilities to tourists visiting Telangana. Part of their mission is also to promote unknown tourist spots in Telangana.</em></p>
